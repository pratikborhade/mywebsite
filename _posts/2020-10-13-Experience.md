### Natixis | IT Quant Consultant 
# November 2017 to Present in Paris, France

Natixis is a corporate and investment bank. Our team develops pricer for sophisticated derived instruments (primarily Options) with help of pricing models developed by quantitative team. We are also responsible for developing and maintaining projects to calculate sensitivities (Greeks), building and maintaining a framework for distributed computing to solve time consuming calculations like Credit Value Adjustment and creating attractive UI applications in C# which is used by traders to visualize data. My key contributions are as follows.
* Created a rich library for Apache Phoenix, Hive using ODBC drivers and power of template metaprogramming. This library is easy to use and develop. It helped my fellow colleagues to easily put in place various projects which used these technologies to store huge amounts of data.
* Developed and maintained project to calculate Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) and Expected Effective Positive Exposure(EEPE) with help of models developed by Quantitative Team.
* Planning and brain storming the architecture for the ecosystem of CVA and EEPE Calculations.
* Designing tables in Apache Phoenix to save the data related to CVA and EEPE calculations.
* Developed and maintained project to distribute the CVA and EEPE calculation on multiple servers as they are quite time consuming.
* Creating packages in scala to do post processing on CVA and EEPE data using Spark(Engine to use YARN Hadoop for data processing).
* Writing documentation and flowcharts to help the support team put the ecosystem of CVA and EEPE in User Acceptance Test(UAT) and Production. Helping the support team with technical issues faced during deployment these ecosystems.
* Writing python scripts to analyze the state of ecosystem to send daily reports.
* Optimizing communication between Stress Test servers (Master-Slave architecture). I successfully improved memory consumption by a factor of 10.This was done by finding strategies to remove redundant information and aggregating important data to send it once.
* Developing new scenarios in Sophis as defined by the user specifications. Fixing various issues faced while using Sophis toolkit and MFC.
* Optimizing existing code for time and memory, by profiling techniques and analyzing code for potential improvements in algorithms and memory leaks.
* Introduced unit tests for all new developments, supported the team by introducing them to new technologies and developed new techniques and tools for Hadoop. Re-factoring legacy code whenever there are bugfixes.
