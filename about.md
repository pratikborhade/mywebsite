I am a passionate software engineer. I am a keen and a quick learner. I have quite an experience in C++ and C#. But it seems C++ is so vast that every day i am learning something new. During my college days I use to code quite good algorithms but without using any standard library a "C" like code. Each experience I have had greatly increased my vision to write more maintainable and bugfree code using the standard library and features of modern C++. Scala and Python has also opened a new world for me. I believe in writing a clean easy to read code. I have also worked 7 years as of November 2020 on Sophis and its toolkit. So i have worked in Finance mostly on different financial instruments and portfolios. I am not an expert in finance per se I know very well the concepts.

Apart from that I have a beautiful family and a relaxed life. I am vert luck to have them.
